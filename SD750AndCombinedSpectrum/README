    Values which describe the correlation between bins in the unfolding process is given for
    each energy bin. The first column and first row indicate the energy in base-10 log of
    in energy / eV. This file corresponds to the combined spectrum (see section 5)

    Values which describe the correlation between bins in the unfolding process is given for
    each energy bin. The first column and first row indicate the energy in base-10 log of
    in energy / eV. This file corresponds to the measurement of the energy spectrum using
    only the sd750 (see section 4).
    
File: migrationmatrix.sd750.txt
    The bin migration in the unfolding process are given in this file. The values correspond
    to the R_{ij} which define the expected values v_i = sum_j(R_{ij} u_j). See section 4.

File: spectrum.combined.txt
    The values of the combined spectrum and related errors are given in this file. These
    values correspond to the values in Table 10. Note these values were updated 2022.04.20.

File: spectrum.sd750.txt
    The values of the SD750 spectrum and related errors are given in this file. These
    values correspond to the values in Table 8
